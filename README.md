Introduction
Hi there, I'm Abdulrahman and I'm a full-stack web developer. I specialize in building web applications using React, Node.js, and MongoDB. This portfolio showcases some of my recent projects and highlights my skills and experience in web development

I started learning web development as a hobby, but quickly found that it was something I enjoyed doing and decided to pursue it as a career. I have a passion for building engaging user interfaces and creating applications that make people's lives easier.

## installation

To run any of these applications, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your computer. Once you have those installed, you can clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
